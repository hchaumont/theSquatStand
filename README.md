# theSquatStand
The Squat Stand is a webapp implementing some of the most basic features of the (now-defunct) website thesquatrack.com. It is used to track workout history, with an emphasis on weightlifting and powerlifting training.

In addition to tracking workout history, the Squat Stand generates summary statistics including workout/daily/weekly volume and rep counts and tracks personal bests on each exercise.
